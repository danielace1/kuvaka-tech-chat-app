# Kuvaka Tech - ðŸ’¬ Real-Time Chat App

A real-time chat application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and **WebSockets**. Users can join by entering a username and chat instantly with others in real-time. Messages are saved to a MongoDB database and chat history is automatically loaded.

- **Backend** (Render): https://kuvaka-tech-chat-app-backend.onrender.com

## Technologies Used :

- **_Frontend_**: React.js, TailwindCSS
- **_Backend_**: Node.js, Express.js, WebSocket
- **_Database_**: MongoDB with Mongoose

## Architecture Overview :

- **Frontend**: React SPA with WebSocket client
- **Backend**: Express.js server + native WebSocket server via `ws` package
- **Database**: MongoDB stores messages with timestamps
- **WebSocket**: Manages real-time communication and message broadcasting

## Features :

- Real-time chat using WebSocket
- Message persistence with MongoDB
- Automatically loads previous 50 messages
- Simple username-based entry (no authentication)
- Graceful handling of connection/disconnection
- Leave chat functionality with confirmation

## Concurrency Handling:

- A `Set` tracks all active WebSocket clients.
- Each socket is associated with a username using a `Map`.
- On new connection:
  - Server receives `{ type: "init", username }`
  - Sends back recent message history
- When a user sends a message:
  - Server saves to MongoDB
  - Broadcasts the message to all connected clients using `WebSocket.OPEN` status
- On disconnect:
  - The user is removed from active socket tracking

## WebSocket Communication Flow :

- Client connects to WebSocket and sends `{ type: "init", username }`.
- Server stores the socket-user mapping, sends recent chat history.
- User sends a message `{ type: "message", message }`.
- Server stores the message in MongoDB and broadcasts to all connected clients.
- On disconnect, server cleans up socket-user tracking.

## Assumptions & Design Choices

- Messages are stored with timestamps and retrieved in order.
- WebSocket is used natively instead of Socket.io to keep the stack lightweight.
- A simple username-based login is used for quick entry; no authentication.
- day.js is used for lightweight date formatting.
- Message sending is disabled on empty input to avoid blank messages.
- Disconnection is handled gracefully with a confirmation prompt.

## Using the App :

- Open the frontend URL.
- Enter a username to join the chat.
- Start chatting with others in real time!
